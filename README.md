This is a prolog assignment for my second year ai course in uni. Uses a shortest path algorthim to find the shortest train route between stations. 
It uses a Shortest path algorithm to search through the possible stations to find the lowest cost path
Examples to use 

'distance(welshpool, bangor, Distance, Stops).'

this would return

'Distance = 165,
Stops = [welshpool, oswestry, corwen, bala, llandudno, bangor]'
